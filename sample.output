Video is a versatile and engaging content format that not only gives us a real-life picture of what is going on; it’s also easy to share across multiple platforms.

97% of marketers claim that videos help customers understand products.

Consumers and businesses simply don't’ need to be sold to; instead, they’re doing a quick internet search to find the best product in their neighbourhood or even in the world where they’ll proceed to order it online.

To this end, marketers in many fields (perhaps not all) need to approach audiences with a value-based offer instead of a “sale.
”
And videos excel at giving customers a really up-close look at a product, service, or even an influencer or teacher.

Videos are amazing for getting all sorts of messages out there, and if we think in terms of practicality, a short, unique explainer video can do a world of difference when it comes to educating people on the ins and outs of your particular product.

If you’re in a digital marketing career, or you’re heading in that direction, you’ll need to learn how to create basic videos and optimize them.

Okay, there you have some amazing reasons for incorporating video into your marketing activities, or learning how to create awesome videos if you’re interested in digital marketing careers.

Other things you’ll want to to to ensure the best engagement and accessibility as well as boost your SEO include using captions for autoplay and keeping the video on silent if it’s on a landing page.
